## Checking SSH Setup

1. Check if you have any existing SSH keys:
```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

Look for files named:
- `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`
- `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`

2. Test your SSH connection to GitHub:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated...", you're all set!

## Setting Up SSH

If you don't have SSH keys or need to create new ones:

1. Generate a new SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

2. Start the SSH agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH key to the agent:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

4. Copy your public key:
```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

5. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Give it a title (e.g., "MacBook Pro")
   - Paste your key into the "Key" field
   - Click "Add SSH key"

6. Verify the setup:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
If you get permission errors:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### SSH Agent Issues
If the SSH agent isn't running:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Multiple SSH Keys
If you have multiple SSH keys, create or edit `~/.ssh/config`:
```bash
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
