## Setup

### Node.js and NPM

You will be needing Node.js, npm, and pnpm installed in your system.

#### Checking Installation

To verify if Node.js, npm, and pnpm are installed on your system, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
pnpm --version
```

2. If Node.js is not installed, you'll see a "command not found" error. Install Node.js using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

3. After installation, verify again using the version commands:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

4. For npm, it comes bundled with Node.js installation. If you need to update npm:
```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

5. Install pnpm using npm:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### Required Versions
- Node.js: 18.x or higher (LTS version recommended)
- npm: 9.x or higher
- pnpm: 8.x or higher

</Callout>

1. **Create a folder for your project and open the terminal there:**
   - Choose or create a directory where you want to keep your project (for example, `Projects` or `Work`).
   - Open your file explorer, create a new folder (e.g., `cloved`), and open the terminal in that folder.
   - On macOS, you can right-click the folder and select "New Terminal at Folder" (or use the menu in Finder: `Go > Utilities > Terminal`, then use `cd` to navigate to your folder).

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fractaljs/cloved.git
cd cloved
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
