title: Adding Images to the Docs
---

<br />


### 1. Export the Image from Figma as PNG

1. **Open Figma** and navigate to the image you want to export.
2. **Select** the specific frame, group, or layer you want to export as an image.
3. In the right sidebar, scroll down to the **Export** section.
4. Click the **+** icon to add an export setting if it's not already there.
5. Set the format to **PNG** (recommended for guidelines).
6. Click the **Export [Layer/Frame Name]** button.
7. Save the exported PNG to your computer (remember where you save it).

### 2. Locate the Guidelines Image Directory

1. In your project, go to:
   ```
   apps/docs/public/img/guidelines
   ```

   or
   <Callout type="info">
   Press `CMD + P` and type `img`  to see where the other images are located.
   </Callout>
2. Here, you'll see folders for different components (e.g., `button`, `menu`).

### 3. Create a Folder for the Component (if needed)

- If a folder for your component **already exists** (e.g., `button`), open it.
- If it **does not exist**:
  1. Create a new folder inside `guidelines`.
  2. Name the folder after your component, using lowercase letters (e.g., `dropdown`, `modal`).

### 4. Add the Image with the Correct Naming Convention

- Place your PNG image inside the relevant component folder.
- **Naming convention:**
  - For a "do" image: `DO_<NAME_IN_CAPITAL_WITH_UNDERSCORES>.png`
  - For a "don't" image: `DONT_<NAME_IN_CAPITAL_WITH_UNDERSCORES>.png`

  **Examples:**
  - `DO_PROPER_BUTTON_SPACING.png`
  - `DONT_USE_WRONG_COLOR.png`

### 5. Use the Image in the `Guideline` Component

Instead of referencing the image directly in markdown, you should use the `Guideline` component to display guideline images in your documentation. This component is designed to show both "Do" and "Don't" images side by side, along with helpful labels and pointers.

#### Example Usage (from `Menu.mdx`):

```tsx
import Guideline from "@/ui/components/Guideline";

<Guideline
  title="Min width of the menu should be that of the dropdown"
  doLabel="Allow the menu to take the width of the dropdown"
  dontLabel="Avoid wrapping menu width to content"
  doImage="/img/guidelines/menu/DO_MIN_WIDTH.png" // Path to the "do" image
  dontImage="/img/guidelines/menu/DONT_MIN_WIDTH.png" // Path to the "don't" image
/>
```

- The `doImage` and `dontImage` props should point to the image paths you added in the previous steps.
- Make sure the path matches the folder and filename you used in `public/img/guidelines/<component>/<image_name>.png`.

This approach keeps your documentation consistent and visually clear for users.

By following these steps, you ensure all guideline images are organized and named consistently, making them easy to find and reference in the documentation.
